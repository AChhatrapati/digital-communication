\item Let X represent the difference between the number of heads and the number of
tails obtained when a coin is tossed 6 times. What are possible values of X?
\item A black and a red dice are rolled.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the conditional probability of obtaining a sum greater than 9, given
that the black die resulted in a 5.
    \item Find the conditional probability of obtaining the sum 8, given that the red die
resulted in a number less than 4.

 \item If each element of a $2\times 2$ determinant is either zero or one. What is the probability that the value of the determinant is positive ? 
 (Assume that the individual entries of the determinant are chosen independently each value being assumed with probability $\frac{1}{2}$) \\
