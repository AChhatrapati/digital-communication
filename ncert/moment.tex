\item Two dice are thrown simultaneously. If X denotes the number of sixes, find the
expectation of X.

\item Two numbers are selected at random (without replacement) from the first six
positive integers. Let X denote the larger of the two numbers obtained. Find
E(X).

\item Let X denote the sum of the numbers obtained when two fair dice are rolled.
Find the variance and standard deviation of X.

\item A class has 15 students whose ages are 14, 17, 15, 14, 21, 17, 19, 20, 16, 18, 20,
17, 16, 19 and 20 years. One student is selected in such a manner that each has
the same chance of being chosen and the age X of the selected student is
recorded. What is the probability distribution of the random variable X? Find
mean, variance and standard deviation of X.

\item In a meeting, 70% of the members favour and 30% oppose a certain proposal.
A member is selected at random and we take X = 0 if he opposed, and X = 1 if
he is in favour. Find E(X) and Var (X).\\

Choose the correct answer in each of the following:



\item The mean of the numbers obtained on throwing a die having written 1 on three
faces, 2 on two faces and 5 on one face is
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1
\item 2
\item 5
\item $\frac{8}{3}$

\end{enumerate}

\item Suppose that two cards are drawn at random from a deck of cards. Let X be the
number of aces obtained. Then the value of E(X) is
\begin{enumerate}

\item $\frac{37}{221}$
\item $\frac{5}{13}$
\item $\frac{1}{13}$
\item $\frac{2}{13}$

\end{enumerate}
