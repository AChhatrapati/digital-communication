	\item A team of medical students doing their internship have to assist during surgeries
at a city hospital. The probabilities of surgeries rated as very-complex, complex,
routine, simple or very-simple are respectively, 0.15, 0.20, 0.31, 0.26, .08. Find
the probabilities that a particular surgery will be rated
\begin{enumerate}
\item complex or very-complex
\item neither very-complex nor very simple
\item routine or complex
\item routine or simple
\end{enumerate}

	\item The accompanying Venn diagram in 
\figref{fig:exemplar/11/16/3/11/Venn_Diagram}
		shows three events, A, B, and C, and also the probabilities of the various intersections (for instance, \pr{AB} = .07). Determine
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\pr{A}
\item 
\pr{BC^\prime}
\item 
\pr{A + B}
\item 
\pr{AB^\prime}
\item 
\pr{BC}
\item 
Probability of exactly one
of the three occurs.
